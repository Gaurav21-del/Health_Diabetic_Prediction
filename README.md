Data Analytics Project: Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis

Objective: Utilized a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to predict diabetes in Pima Indian females aged 21 and above.
Key Contributions:
Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers for attributes like Skin Thickness and Insulin.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations between diagnostic measurements and diabetes outcomes.
Developed and evaluated machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict diabetes with high accuracy.
Visualized data insights and model performance metrics using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau.
Key Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), SQL, Tableau.
Outcome: Achieved a predictive accuracy of XX% (fill in with your result) and identified key factors influencing diabetes predictions, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.
#Conclusion of the Dataset Analysis
Objective: The primary aim was to determine whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

Key Insights:

Significant Features: Glucose levels, BMI, and age emerged as critical factors associated with diabetes.
EDA Findings: Patterns showed higher glucose levels and BMI are common in patients with a diabetes diagnosis (Outcome = 1).
Machine Learning Results: The [best-performing model] achieved an accuracy of XX% in classifying diabetes cases.
Impact: The analysis demonstrated how diagnostic measurements could effectively predict diabetes, providing actionable insights for early detection and healthcare interventions.
