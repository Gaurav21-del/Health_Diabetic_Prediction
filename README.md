#Conclusion of the Dataset Analysis
Objective: The primary aim was to determine whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

Key Insights:

Significant Features: Glucose levels, BMI, and age emerged as critical factors associated with diabetes.
EDA Findings: Patterns showed higher glucose levels and BMI are common in patients with a diabetes diagnosis (Outcome = 1).
Machine Learning Results: The [best-performing model] achieved an accuracy of XX% in classifying diabetes cases.
Impact: The analysis demonstrated how diagnostic measurements could effectively predict diabetes, providing actionable insights for early detection and healthcare interventions.
